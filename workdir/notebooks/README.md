# Notebooks

The notebooks used for explorative data analysis can be stored here. When you start the project with docker compose using `docker compose --profile development up -d`, the folder `workkdir` will be mounted to the container and you can access the notebooks via the jupyter lab interface in your browser at <http://localhost:8888>.
